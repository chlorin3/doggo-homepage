        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-8">
                <p>My name is Taika. I am a Bavarian Mountain Hound mix. I was born in October 2018 in a village called Mierzeszyn (Kashubian: Miérzëszëno), Pomeranian Voivodeship, northern Poland.
        I used to live with a quite big family. There were two children, their parents and a grandmother. Kids were about 3 and 6 years old, so there was a chaos at home and I took part in it as well.
        I was a really vocal dog without any control. But then I was adopted and moved to Gdańsk in April 2019 (look at the map).</p>
        <p>My new parents started to train me, taught me commands and manners. So now I am just a vocal dog, but still pretty anxious when it comes to strangers.
        It has been <span id="years"></span> years<span id="months"> </span>since they adopted me.</p>
        <p>In July 2022 we moved to small town not so far from Wroclaw.
        I used to be a beach dog that fell in love with digging holes in sand, but now I am a mountain doggo that spends lots of time hiking and digging holes in dirt.
        Sometimes I even bring dead animals' parts from the woods - awesome.</p>

    <h3>Appearance</h3>
    <p>I am 41 cm high and weigh between 16 and 18 kg.</p>
    <p>My coat is short (but a bit longer than Bavarian Mountain Hound's one), shiny and moderately harsh. It is
        finer on the head and ears, harsher and longer on the abdomen, legs, and tail. It is in a shade of
        black-masked fawn.</p>
    <p> I am very wary towards strangers or anyone I don't know approaching me or my humans. I am vigilant and very attached to my family. When hunting, I am hard, single-minded, and persistent,
        courageous, spirited, fast and agile. I am at ease on a rugged terrain, with a superb nose and powerful
        hunting instinct.</p>

    <h3>Care</h3>
    <p>I am not suited for city life and that is why I have recently moved to a small town in the central Sudetan.
        Space and great amount of exercise is essential to me. If I am not kept mentally stimulated I may become bored, unhappy and sometimes destructive.
        Other than that, I also require regular brushing.</p>
